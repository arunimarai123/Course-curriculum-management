# Course and Curriculum Management Project (Course and Curriculum Management)

## ðŸ“– Overview
Course and Curriculum Management is a **console-based Java SE application** that simulates a campus course and student records management system.  
It demonstrates key Java concepts such as **OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism)**,  
exception handling, enums, streams, lambdas, recursion, Singleton & Builder patterns, and file I/O with NIO.2.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Student Management**: add, update, deactivate, list, and print student profiles.
- **Course Management**: add, update, deactivate, search, and filter courses.
- **Enrollment & Grading**: enroll students, record grades, compute GPA, and generate transcripts.
- **File Utilities**: import/export CSV data, backup files with timestamps, recursive file utilities.
- **Menu-driven CLI**: simple console interface to navigate operations.

## ðŸ“š Java Concepts Demonstrated
| Concept                | Where Implemented |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Encapsulation          | `Student.java`, `Course.java` |
| Inheritance            | `Person.java` â†’ `Student.java` |
| Abstraction            | `Person.java` (abstract class) |
| Polymorphism           | `TranscriptService.java` |
| Immutability           | `CourseCode.java` |
| Nested Classes         | `Course.Builder` |
| Interfaces & Lambdas   | Comparator lambdas in utilities |
| Singleton Pattern      | `AppConfig.java` |
| Builder Pattern        | `Course.java` |
| Exception Handling     | `DuplicateEnrollmentException.java`, `MaxCreditLimitExceededException.java` |
| Streams API            | Planned in reports & filtering |
| Date/Time API          | Used in enrollments, backups |
